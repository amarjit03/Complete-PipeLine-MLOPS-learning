# Complete-PipeLine-MLOPS-learning

This project covers the end-to-end understanding of creating an ML pipeline and working around it using DVC for experiment tracking and data versioning (using AWS S3).

## Introduction

This repository demonstrates the complete process of setting up a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline. The main components include:
- Data versioning with DVC
- Experiment tracking
- Integration with AWS S3 for storage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amarjit03/Complete-PipeLine-MLOPS-learning.git
